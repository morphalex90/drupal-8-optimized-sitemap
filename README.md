<h1>Drupal 8 - Optimized Sitemap (work in progress)</h1>

<p>Search engines requires xml sitemaps in websites in order to understand what to see but in most of the Drupal 8 sitemap modules I've see that the image integration is laking so I decided to create my personal module</p>

<p>Features</p>
<ul>
  <li>you can enable it for all the entity types and choose that content type to use it</li>
  <li>For each content type (and taxonomy) you can select what image field enable to be in the sitemap</li>
  <li>it can regenerete the sitemap with the Drupal internal cron</li>
</ul>

<p>Roadmap</p>
<ul>
  <li>custom back-end pages with cron configurations (done)</li>
  <li>list of entity types (in progress...)</li>
</ul>
